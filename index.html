        Hello<br>Welcome to my experimentation website.
      </h3>
        This (very static) web page is just a <i>beginners</i> attempt to learn the HTML tags at the most basic level.
        So far
        <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/">HTML Source</a> website has been useful.
        Edits to this test website are being done in the web editor on github and validated on
        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">w3's validator</a>.

        <h2>
          <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/">Gist</a>
        </h2>
        I have used
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/">Gist</a>
        for development of code to test various random bits and pieces.
        So far there is some
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/923ada0f621b43ce18e06c5388ccb2d4/">Python code</a>
        snippets and some RFO Basic! (Basic interpretter on Android phone) snippets on Gist.
        Since I am the only person working on the code I am only using the Master branch.
        The workflow for the single file of python code on my home PC is very simple -<br>
        edit & test code, <b>git add</b> code, <b>git commit</b>, <b>git push</b> and then repeat.<br>
        Some of the time I edit in the web browser, then do a <b>git pull</b> to test the code.
        <br>

        <h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/">Github</a>
        </h2>
        I have also used
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/">Github</a>
        for development of more substantial programs. For example, I have worked on a command line file dump utility, named  
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/ihad/">ihad</a>
        using Github.
        The ihad program dumps the bytes in a file as lines of "index", "hexadecimal" and "ASCII" formatted text.
        It gave me an opportunity to try creating a branch and then merging it back into the master branch.
        Didn't work as expected, so more reading required. It also was a trial of using RCS and git in the same project.
        Didn't help and only led to confusion. I also have put an
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/SudokuHelp/">Excel workbook on it that helps a person solve Sudoku puzzles</a>
        and a python script named
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/checktime/">checktime.py</a>
        that attempts to check the time on another networked device by sending an (IPv4)
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792">ICMP</a> timestamp request and waiting for a corresponding timestamp reply.
        There is also a
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/pingDemo/">pingDemo</a>
        in the
        <a href="https://golang.org/">go</a>
        language, which attempts to determine if another network device is alive by sending an (IPv4) ICMP echo request (i.e. ping) and waiting for a
        corresponding ICMP echo reply.

        </h2>
        Some of my computing devices are available for use to Scientific computing bodies such as
        <a href="https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/">World Community Grid</a>,
        <a href="https://einsteinathome.org/">Einstein@Home</a>,
        <a href="https://asteroidsathome.net/index.html">Asteroids@Home</a>. Experimenting with
        BOINC settings on various devices resulted in me developing a preference to setting aside
        a proportion of the available CPUs, but making those CPUs 100% available.
