        Hello<br>Welcome to my test website.
      </h3>
        This web page is just a <i>beginners</i> attempt to learn the HTML tags at the most basic level.
        So far
        <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/">HTML Source</a> website has been useful.
        Edits to this test website are being done in the web editor on github and validated on
        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">w3's validator</a>.

        <h2>

        </h2>
        I am using 
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/">Gist</a>
        for development of code to test various random bits and pieces.
        So far there is some
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/923ada0f621b43ce18e06c5388ccb2d4/">Python code</a>
        and some RFO Basic! snippets on Gist.
        The Python code has been my most substantial use of git so far.
        Since I am the only person working on the code I am only using the Master branch.
        The workflow for the single file of python code on my home PC is very simple -<br>
        edit & test code, <b>git add</b> code, <b>git commit</b>, <b>git push</b> and then repeat.<br>
        Some of the time I edit in the web browser, then do a <b>git pull</b> to test the code.
        <br>

        <h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/">Github</a>
        </h2>
        I have put
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/ihad/">ihad.c</a>
        up on
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/">Github</a>
        . It gave me an opportunity to try creating a branch and then merging it back into the master branch.
        Didn't work as expected, so more reading required. It also was a trial of using RCS and git in the same project.
        Didn't help and only led to confusion. I also have put an
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/SudokuHelp/">Excel workbook on it that helps but doesn't solve Sudoku puzzles</a>
        and a python script named
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/checktime/">checktime.py</a>
        that attempts to check the time on another networked device using (IPv4)
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792">ICMP</a> timestamp.
        There is also a
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/pingDemo/">pingDemo.go</a>
        in the
        <a href="https://golang.org/">go</a>
        language.
