        Hello<br>Welcome to my test website.
      </h3>
        It is just a <i>beginners</i> attempt to learn the HTML tags at the most basic level.
        <br>
        I am using 
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/">Gist</a>
        for development of code to test various random bits and pieces.
        So far there is some
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/923ada0f621b43ce18e06c5388ccb2d4/">Python code</a>
        and some RFO Basic! snippets on Gist.
        The Python code has been my most substantial use of git so far.
        Since I am the only person working on the code I am only using the Master branch.
        The workflow for the single file of python code on my home PC is very simple -<br>
        edit & test code, <b>git add</b> code, <b>git commit</b>, <b>git push</b> and then repeat.<br>
        Some of the time I edit in the web browser, then do a <b>git pull</b> to test the code.
