        Hello<br>Welcome to my experimentation website.
      </h3>
        This (very static) web page is just a <i>beginners</i> attempt to learn the HTML tags at the most basic level.
        So far
        <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/">HTML Source</a> website has been useful.
        Edits to this test website are being done in the web editor on github and validated on
        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">w3's validator</a>.

        <h2>

        </h2>
        I have used
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/">Gist</a>
        for development of code to test various random bits and pieces.
        Among them are python snippets like
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/923ada0f621b43ce18e06c5388ccb2d4/">rawScktPing.py</a>
        and
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/460e8d4f0b9dbb37b0273ecb39aab17e/">connect four game c4.py</a>
        and some
        <a href="https://rfobasic.com/">RFO Basic!</a>
        (Basic interpreter on Android phone) snippets on Gist.
        Since I am the only person working on the code I am only using the Master branch.
        The workflow for the single file of python code on my home PC is very simple -<br>
        edit & test code, <b>git add</b> code, <b>git commit</b>, <b>git push</b> and then repeat.<br>
        Some of the time I edit in the web browser, then do a <b>git pull</b> to test the code.

        A table of Gists with the most recent at the top is; -

        </h2>
        I have used
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/">Github</a>
        for development of more substantial programs. For example, I have worked on a command line file dump utility, named  
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/ihad/">ihad</a>
        using Github.
        The ihad program dumps the bytes in a file as lines of "index", "hexadecimal" and "ASCII" formatted text.
        It gave me an opportunity to try creating a branch and then merging it back into the master branch.
        Didn't work as expected, so more reading required. It also was a trial of using RCS and git in the same project.
        Didn't help and only led to confusion. I also have put an
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/SudokuHelp/">Excel workbook on it that helps a person solve Sudoku puzzles</a>
        and a python script named
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/checktime/">checktime.py</a>
        that attempts to check the time on another networked device by sending an (IPv4)
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792">ICMP</a> timestamp request and waiting for a corresponding timestamp reply.
        There is also a
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/pingDemo/">pingDemo</a>
        in the
        <a href="https://golang.org/">go</a>
        language, which attempts to determine if another network device is alive by sending an (IPv4) ICMP echo request (i.e. ping) and waiting for a
        corresponding ICMP echo reply. Most recently I am working on a c language utility named
        <a href="https://github.com/dutchLuck/ping3/">ping3</a>
        to provide aspects of the linux/unix ping utility on macOS and vice-versa.

          <a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu/">Volunteer Computing using BOINC</a>
        </h2>
        Most of my computing devices are available for use to Scientific computing bodies
        that use 
        <a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC</a>,
        such as
        <a href="https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/">World Community Grid</a>,
        <a href="https://einsteinathome.org/">Einstein@Home</a>,
        <a href="https://asteroidsathome.net/index.html">Asteroids@Home</a>.
        Experimenting with BOINC settings on various devices running Windows,
        macOS, Linux and Android resulted in developing a preference (learning?)
        to set aside a proportion of the available CPUs,
        but to make those CPUs 100% available.
        Attempts to get GPU computing functioning well is more difficult.
